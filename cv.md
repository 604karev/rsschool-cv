# Kirill Hrudiznski 
### Front End Developer

## General information

I am good at layout, I know BEM, I use the SASS preprocessor, bootstrap3 / bootstrap4,
flexbox, css grid. I can easily find and fix layout bugs, 
I can improve loading performance. I know JS, I use ES6,
I worked with React / Redux, I made a couple of non-commercial applications with this framework.

My english level is strong pre-intermediate: I can connect between two
words, but some time I have problems, but this doesn't prevent for me to understand the tasks that are given to me.
